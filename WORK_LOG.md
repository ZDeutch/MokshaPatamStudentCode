| September 3  |   2:15 - 3 pm    |                                                                                                                                       I visualize the problem as a BFS algorithm where you want to explore every option until you reach the end and return the number of moves. While I initially thought a grid would be the best way to code this, I think a simple array of square objects could be better, and then determine whether each square has a ladder. |
| September 4  | 10:10 - 10:45 pm |                                                          I now understand that this project is going to involve BFS because you want to find the most efficient path, and a queue is better since it searches each level. I am not sure yet how I will actually set up and run the queue, but I do know a couple of the variables I want to track. I kept the Square class just to show where I was initially thinking, but it is no longer useful for my thinking. |
| September 9  | 11:35 - 11:55 am |                                                                                                                                                                                 I mainly focused on resolving my github issues which I learned came from a buffer size error. From there, I started by copying over the pseudocode from class and began initializing the arrays for the snakes and ladder. My goal for next work session is to implement the queue. |
| September 9  |  9:15 - 9:45 pm  | I began by coding the board of booleans representing where I visited. This is important to ensure that my code takes an optimal path, and doesn't have repeat/uneccesary moves. Additionally, I figured out how to initilize the queue. The next step is to consider what happens each roll, and the 1-6 outcomes that could result. That part will involve making sure you dont overshoot the target, haven't visited the square already, and incrememnting rolls. |
| September 10 | 10:00 - 10:30 am |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I started to write out the code that I see as the final algorithm. However, when testing, my roll number is too high. This indicates I need to do some debugging to find the error. |
