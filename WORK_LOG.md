While I initially thought a grid would be the best way to code this, I think a simple array of square objects could be better, and then determine whether each square has a ladder. |
| September 4 | 10:10 - 10:45 pm | I now understand that this project is going to involve BFS because you want to find the most efficient path, and a queue is better since it searches each level. I am not sure yet how I will actually set up and run the queue, but I do know a couple of the variables I want to track. I kept the Square class just to show where I was initially thinking, but it is no longer useful for my thinking. |
